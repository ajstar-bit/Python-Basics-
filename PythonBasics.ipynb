What is python and why is it popular?"],"metadata":{"id":"nCAb-GR33IkQ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- Python is a high-level, easy-to-learn programming language known for its clear syntax and versatility. It’s popular because it can be used for web development, data science, automation, artificial intelligence, and more."],"metadata":{"id":"WQUlV3X_4TkL"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["2. What is an interpreter in Python?"],"metadata":{"id":"2xrOSl_K41GL"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line, converting it into machine code that the computer can understand."],"metadata":{"id":"1faQ8_rN5PvJ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?"],"metadata":{"id":"dTDRbhnI57PV"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meaning in the language. They are used to define the syntax and structure of Python programs, so you cannot use them as variable names, function names, or identifiers."],"metadata":{"id":"knEHNxU76Lg3"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["4. Can keywords be used as variable names?"],"metadata":{"id":"ZUPQxCts6pA2"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python because they are reserved for specific language functions and syntax."],"metadata":{"id":"F_6nc0kb6-B7"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["5. What is mutability in Python?"],"metadata":{"id":"5yvE5bAI7V56"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- Mutability in Python refers to the ability of an object to be modified after it has been created. If an object is mutable, its content or state can be changed without creating a new object in memory."],"metadata":{"id":"Vq3t15iJ7l-M"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?"],"metadata":{"id":"f-ye-QPL75N0"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- Lists are mutable because they are designed for collections of items that may need to change, such as adding, removing, or modifying elements. Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable to provide stability, making them suitable for fixed data like records or keys in dictionaries."],"metadata":{"id":"p_Tom95P8Lwd"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["7. What is the difference between \"==\" and \"is\" operators in Python?"],"metadata":{"id":"V2XWnQA48yrK"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- In Python, \"==\" checks if two variables have the same value, while \"is\" checks if they refer to the same object in memory."],"metadata":{"id":"0R5sC7Ce86em"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["8. What are logical operators in Python?"],"metadata":{"id":"GEBsGohT9ppi"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- Logical operators in Python are used to combine multiple conditions in a single expression.

What is type casting in Python?"],"metadata":{"id":"3ng361m5hJr4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- Type casting in Python is the process of converting a value from one data type to another. It allows you to change the data type of a variable, for example, from a string to an integer or from a float to a string."],"metadata":{"id":"xmvAQaQPhj5B"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?"],"metadata":{"id":"C08qlCkciHm6"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- The difference between implicit and explicit type casting in Python is:\n","- Implicit Type Casting is done automatically by Python when converting a value from one data type to another, usually when there's no risk of data loss.\n","- Explicit Type Casting is done manually by the programmer using built-in functions like int(), float(), or str(). This is used when you want to force a specific conversion."],"metadata":{"id":"q8T_VO_qjMMx"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?"],"metadata":{"id":"x4Wf4umAkNoD"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to allow the program to make decisions and execute certain blocks of code based on whether a condition is True or False. They help control the flow of the program by enabling it to perform different actions in different situations."],"metadata":{"id":"t1JV9fUBkfeQ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["12. How does the elif statement work?"],"metadata":{"id":"1Q78GRHdlRfq"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- The elif statement in Python stands for \"else if\" and is used to check multiple conditions after an initial if statement. It runs only if the previous if (or elif) condition is False. You can have multiple elif blocks to handle different cases, and it helps keep the code clean and readable."],"metadata":{"id":"GyqjFpbKlWCm"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["13. What is the difference between for and while loops?"],"metadata":{"id":"ij51GifllkHa"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- The main difference between for and while loops in Python lies in how they control repetition:\n","\n","for loop is used when you know in advance how many times you want to iterate. It loops over a sequence like a list, tuple, string, or a range of numbers.\n","\n","while loop is used when you don’t know how many times to repeat and want to continue looping as long as a condition is true."],"metadata":{"id":"bukO7dRRmE_0"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop."],"metadata":{"id":"MpOP3nn4mQSc"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- Suppose you're writing a program that keeps asking a user to enter the correct password.
